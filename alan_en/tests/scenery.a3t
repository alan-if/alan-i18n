Lost in the Desert
You're surrounded by dunes. A fierce sun looms above you, following you
wherever you go. The heat is unbearable, you need to find water.
A lonely cactus rises tall from the sand, next to an abandoned pit. In
the distance you glimpse tumbleweeds rolling across the sand. There is a 
skorpion here.
