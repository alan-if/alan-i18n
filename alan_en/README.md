# About

The __ALAN Foundation Library__ is based on a recovered copy of the legacy __[ALAN Library v0.6.2]__ (the last version of the 0.6.x series), dating back to November, 2007.

The __ALAN Library__ was the result of the collaborative joint effort of Göran Forslund, Thomas Nilsson (now [Thomas Nilefalk]) and Stephen Griffiths over a long period of time.
It was originally written for ALAN&nbsp;2, and then updated to make use of the new features introduced by ALAN&nbsp;3, but its development was soon abandoned if favour of the newer __[ALAN Library 1]__ that was released in 2010, which was superseded by the __[ALAN Standard Library 2]__ in 2016.

The original v0.6.2 code was edited by [Tristano Ajmone] to ensure compatibility with Alan 3.0beta6; also, some outdated references and broken links were updated accordingly.

The library was then renamed in this project from __ALAN Library__ to "Foundation Library" to avoid confusion with the original library (and all other ALAN Libraries), so that we could start updating it to take advantage of the new ALAN&nbsp;3 features that were introduced since 2007.

An archived copy of the original __[ALAN Library v0.6.2]__ can be found at the [ALAN Goodies] project:

- https://github.com/alan-if/alan-goodies/tree/master/libs/ALAN-Library_0.6/

For some background info on the various ALAN libraries created in the course of time, and their history, see:

# Library Status

- [`Foundation/CHANGELOG.md`][CHANGELOG.md]

The __English Foundation Library__ is currently in Beta stage.
We're gradually updating it to take advantage of the new ALAN&nbsp;3 features that were introduced since 2007, as well as refactoring its source code to meet the goals of this project.

Until the library reaches its first stable release with v1.0.0, its code will be subject to frequent changes, including backwards compatibility breaking changes; furthermore, we can't guarantee that its documentation will always be up to date with its latest code changes.
