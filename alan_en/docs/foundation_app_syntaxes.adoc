NOTE: In the *verb* column we've removed any enclosing single quotes from verb identifiers that clash with reserved keywords, to simplify alphabetical sorting and lookup operation.


=== Compatible Syntaxes

Some library verbs have compatible syntaxes, which allow authors (and library maintainers) to override their definitions with a single `VERB` declaration, e.g. to override them in bulk in classes or specific instances.

This section lists together all verbs with compatible syntaxes.

WARNING: TBD!


WARNING: Currently there's an
https://github.com/alan-if/alan-docs/issues/128[open Issue^]
for the _ALAN Manual_ regarding multiple verbs definitions, which will eventually lead to a new section dedicated to this topic, which we should link to once it's available.
