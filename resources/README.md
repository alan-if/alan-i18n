# Library Resources

This folder contains some useful assets for developers wishing to port the Foundation Library to a new locale, or authors wishing to tailor their adventures to their own needs.

# Library Templates

## Runtime Messages

- [`messages_en.i`][messages_en.i] — English messages template.
- [`messages_sv.i`][messages_sv.i] — Swedish messages template.
- [`messages_de.i`][messages_de.i] — German messages template.

The templates contain all the built-in ALAN runtime messages with their default definitions for the English, Swedish or German locale.

A template is going to be very useful if you need to translate the Foundation Library to a new locale, since you'll need to override every default `MESSAGE` with the appropriate translation.
In this case, you might want to copy the whole file into your Foundation folder, as a module of the library, and adapt it to needs.

> **IMPORTANT** — Some library modules already redefine a few `MESSAGE`s; so you'll need to keep an eye for duplicate definitions, in case you decide to integrate one of these templates.

You can also a template as a reference to customize the text of specific responses; in this case you'll probably use it to copy a few messages and paste them in your adventure code.

For a detailed explanation of each `MESSAGE` usage context, and its parameters, see [Appendix C.1][§C.1] of _[The ALAN Manual]_.

Remember that `MESSAGE` definitions are not limited to simple strings.
You can provide dynamic messages by including actual code in their definitions, as described in [§3.15] of _[The ALAN Manual]_.

> **TIP** — You can find the default `MESSAGE` definitions in the [`compiler/msg.c`][msg.c] file of the ALAN source code.
> The first comment line in the `messages_??.i` templates contains the date and commit hash of the `compiler/msg.c` revision against which those strings were last compared:
