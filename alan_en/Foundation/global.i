-- "global.i"

-- To make instance names always be capitalized (e.g. for persons),
-- give the instance a capitalised name in single quotes. Since
-- development version 3.0.29 you don't need another name without the
-- quotes. The compiler converts all player words to lower case before
-- entering them in the dictionary.
